## Synopsis

A servlet written in Java , aiming to make the life of people that use health care simpler, by allowing them to book and monitor their appointments online. Our server uses a local Tomcat server that allowed us to build functionalities for customers, doctors, and administrators.

## Customers

  *booking an appointment according to the availability of a Doctor.
  *viewing their currently pending appointments.
  *canceling an appointment (if atleast 3 days have passed since it's creation).
  *checking their appointments that have taken place already.

## Doctors

Features include : 
  *Viewing their currently pending appointments and their appointment history.
  *Setting availability hours during the work week.
  *Cancelling an appointment
  *Marking appointments as done.

## Administrators

Features include : 
  *Adding doctors to the Database.
  *Adding other administrators to the Database.
  *Deleting the accounts of doctors/customers.
